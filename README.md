## IS-213
## Room Booking Application
This is an open source project for managing room reservations (focusing currently on only our school which is the University of Agder in Kristiansand, Norway). There are several campus buildings with different equipment and room sizes. Our goal is to optimise the booking system for students by having a way to see whether a room is being used or not making it easier to see which rooms are available. The project is currently a work in progress and is in no way finished. This being an MIT licenced project it is open to the public where 


## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

#### Prerequisites
Software that needs to be installed
```
Cocoapods 
Xcode 8.3.2
Swift 3
Firebase 
```

#### Installation
In order to get started and help us out in this project certain steps need to be taken to get the program up and running on your computer. Currently, this project is only developed on Xcode and Windows integration has not been implemented as of this moment. 
This project was written within Xcode version 8.3.2 and using the Swift 3 language, please try to use these versions as they are guaranteed to be compatible with the code available on GitHub, older and or eventual newer versions may have different results, so we recommend sticking to Xcode 8.3.2 and Swift 3.

* The first step is to download Xcode onto your machine, this can be done by the following steps: 

1.	Open the App Store app on your Mac (by default it’s in the Dock).
2.	In the search field in the top-right corner, type Xcode and press the Return key.
3.	The Xcode app shows up as the first search result.
4.	Click Get and then click Install App.
5.	Enter your Apple ID and password when prompted.
6.	Xcode is downloaded into your /Applications directory. (Apple, 2017)

* The second step is to have cocoapods (https://cocoapods.org ) installed on your machine, this is done by typing in the following command into your terminal: 

```$ sudo gem install cocoapods```

* The third step is to get Firebase up and running on your system, this is done so by following these steps: 
[For now, please follow the documentation from the actual fire base google website on how to get it up and running - a more detailed step by step guide for this project is on the to do list]( https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup) - Documentation Firebase

## Contributing
We appreciate all types of contributors that wish to help us in this project. Programming skills are not a necessity, and people with different types of backgrounds are welcome to contribute. 

#### No Code Related Contribution
The following contributions are needed that are not code related: 

##### Artwork 
* Currently the artwork being used are the standard options that come with Xcode, we would appreciate if there were more options available for people to choose between. Some high priority implementations that we would like to implement within our project are different types of themes,and a night/day versions. 

##### Documenation

* We require contributers that are willing to help us on our [Wiki!](https://github.com/maghov/IS-213/wiki) page. Currently, all the information about this project is written on this ReadMe file, but we would like to have better documantion that documents each aspect of our project. 

* A lot of our comments and commits are written in Norwegian, translating documentation to English is needed


#### Code Related Contribution
We appreciate any type of code contribution within our project. The current language being used as of May 2017 is Swift 3.0. 

#### Issues 
The current can be accessed on our issues github tab or by clicking on [This!](https://github.com/maghov/IS-213/issues) link. It consists of features that we wish to implement, and features that are implemented but are not working as desired.
